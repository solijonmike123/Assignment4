        <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
        <p>Imagine having a toolbox with everything you need to build a beautiful and functional website. That's exactly what Bootstrap is! It's like having a secret weapon that helps you build responsive, mobile-first websites quickly and easily, with minimal coding effort. With Bootstrap, you don't have to worry about writing complex CSS or JavaScript code from scratch. Instead, you can rely on pre-designed templates and components to make your website look amazing and work perfectly on all devices.</p>
